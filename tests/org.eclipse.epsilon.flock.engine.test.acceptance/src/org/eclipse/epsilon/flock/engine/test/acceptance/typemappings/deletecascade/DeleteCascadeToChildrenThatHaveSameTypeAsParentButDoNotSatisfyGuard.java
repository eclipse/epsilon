/**
 * This test covers an edge case of cascading delete behaviour. When a cascading delete
 * is to be applied to a model element of type X which also contains other model elements
 * of type X, we need to be sure to delete the children of type X even if they do not satisfy
 * the guard of the deletion rule. In fact, we do not even want to check the applicability
 * of the cascading deletion rule to any children (even if those children are of the same type
 * as the parent element).
